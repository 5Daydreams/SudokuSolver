# SudokuSolver
A 9x9 board generator for the game of Sudoku, this was a study of an algorithm implementation which mimics the idea of Wave Function Collapse (Here is the EPC talk which inspired me to study the WFC: [EPC2018 - Oskar Stalberg - Wave Function Collapse in Bad North](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bcZb-SsnrA&t=27s&ab_channel=BUasGames) ). The speed is suboptimal compared to the actual WFC algorithm and there is a very rare chance that it might need to be run twice;
